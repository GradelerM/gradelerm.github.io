Fearing violence from armed guards, 34 families moved to a new village, where they had been promised 30 x 400 meters of farmland among other compensation. However, upon arrival, they received much smaller plots with poorer soil quality than in Krol Trunsorng. The remaining 22 families, who refused to leave, faced intimidation from security guards. A meeting was held to resolve the dispute, but no agreement was reached. The case was referred to the district Cadastral Commission, which has yet to respond.

In 2001, local people filed complaints with the district chief, provincial governor, and the court, but with little effect. Although the provincial governor called for an environmental and social impact assessment, it was never conducted. The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and ADHOC gathered 187 complaints from eight villages and submitted them to the court, with Legal Aid of Cambodia taking up the case. The villagers sought official recognition of their land rights and the delimitation of their housing and farmland.

As part of its advocacy program, LWF supported the villagers’ land claims. In June 2003, however, a community house LWF built in O Kontrom village was burned down. No arrests were made, and no investigation followed.

Chemical waste from the plantation has poisoned local water sources and killed fish, which is the main source of protein for surrounding communities.

Children have been pulled out of school in order to work for their struggling families.

Company staff prevent local people from going into the forest to collect forest by-products, or sometimes charge a fee to do so, which represents a significant loss of livelihood.

The primary objective was to cultivate food crops, starting with Cavendish bananas and later diversifying into staples like rice, corn, and pineapple, to secure a stable food supply for the food-importing Gulf nation. While Bahrain sought to overcome its arid climate by growing food abroad, the Philippines anticipated benefits such as foreign investment, rural employment, and technology transfer, framing the project as a mutually beneficial arrangement to boost its agricultural exports and develop the countryside, despite concerns from local groups about prioritizing another nation's food security.;No;This venture is an agricultural/food production project, not a carbon offset or reforestation scheme.

Officials announced the $300 million project was proceeding with land identified in Davao.

January 2012: A specific $50 million agriculture investment deal was signed, formalizing the initial capital and operational plan.

2012 (Shortly after the deal): The project faced a major setback as the Philippine partner, AMA Group, announced the deal in Davao ""did not push through"" due to a failure to secure the required 10,000 hectares of contiguous land.

2013: The project was revived but relocated and scaled down. In July, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Alabel, Sarangani, for a smaller banana plantation (starting with 85 hectares), with support from local officials.

In Davao, where the initial plan was shelved, the impact was preemptive; farmer groups like KMP raised alarms about potential displacement, but no actual land conversion or evictions occurred. In Sarangani, the project proceeded with strong support from local leadership, which likely managed community consent. While the community in Domolok witnessed their area become a corporate farm, reports do not specify if the 85 hectares involved displacing families or if the land was idle or willingly leased by private owners. Media coverage lacks details on specific evictions or impacts on indigenous tribes, referring only generally to ""farmers.""";Community traditional or customary rights not recognized by government;"The land tenure status of local communities in the project areas was likely weak and was not formally recognized by the state. Officials treated the earmarked areas as ""public land"" that the government had the authority to lease to investors, suggesting any existing community occupancy lacked formal title. In both the originally planned Davao site and the eventual Sarangani location, there was no evidence of acknowledged community-held tenure, such as Certificates of Ancestral Domain (CADT). Consequently, community land rights were treated as secondary to the investment deal. Instead of receiving compensatory land or strengthened tenure, local communities saw the land allocated to the private venture, fueling criticism from farmer groups who viewed the deal as a ""sell-out"" of land belonging to Filipino tillers.";Limited consultation;Community consultation was minimal. The affected farmers had little to no input in the decision to lease out the land. The project was driven by government officials and private investors, and only after media exposure did farmer organizations get wind and raise objections.;Mixed reaction;"The strongest community reaction came in the form of organizational opposition and media exposé. KMP and allies effectively shamed the deal nationally, which perhaps contributed to it being scaled down. They portrayed it as an affront to Filipino farmers’ rights. Words like “land-grabbing,” “sell-out,” “revolting” capture the sentiment.

However, there’s no record of violent resistance or mass protests (since the project pivoted before reaching a flashpoint in Davao). In Sarangani, the reaction was muted or managed – possibly because conditions or perceptions there were different (the community may have been more receptive due to promised jobs, or less aware of the broader controversy).";Yes;"Yes, the project involved a significant land conflict, though it was primarily social and political rather than violent. The conflict centered on contested land rights, with peasant groups like KMP framing the deal as ""land-grabbing"" and pitting farmers' interests against those of the government and foreign investors. This manifested through public protests, calls for a congressional investigation, and accusations of a conflict of interest against the deal's broker. Overt conflict incidents were avoided because the large-scale project in Davao was halted before evictions could occur. The subsequent, smaller project in Sarangani has operated without publicized conflict, suggesting the issue was managed by relocating to a less contentious area. Overall, the conflict existed mainly in the planning phase, highlighting the underlying tensions between large-scale agribusiness and small farmer land claims in the Philippines.";Unknown;;;;;;;"While the original 10,000-hectare project in Davao posed a credible threat of displacing thousands of farming families, no large-scale forced evictions actually occurred because the plan was ultimately canceled. In Sarangani, the smaller, relocated project appears to have avoided controversy, as there were no reports of displacement, suggesting the land was acquired from willing lessors or was previously unoccupied. The text also raises the concept of ""displacement of opportunity,"" where landless Filipino farmers lose potential access to land allocated to foreign ventures. In summary, no documented forced displacement has occurred to date, primarily due to the project's relocation and significant downsizing, but the initial threat was a central element of the conflict.";Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Other;"The project was criticized for a range of negative impacts that prioritized foreign needs over local welfare. The primary concern was socio-economic dispossession, where local farmers risked losing access to their land and livelihoods, potentially becoming low-wage laborers on their own soil. This raised concerns about worsening local food insecurity, as fertile land would be used for export crops like bananas instead of staples for local consumption. Critics labeled the deal an exploitative ""sell-out"" benefiting elites and foreign investors while exacerbating local poverty. Additional risks included environmental degradation from large-scale monoculture farming, such as heavy agrochemical use and water depletion, as well as the potential for social conflict. While these impacts were feared on a massive scale in the original plan, they remain concerns, albeit smaller in scope, for the relocated project in Sarangani.";There was no known compensation scheme announced for farmers who might lose land or livelihood. Government and investor statements did not mention any resettlement packages, payments, or support for those displaced.;Since the project in its main form didn’t push through in Davao, there were no reports of compensation delivered (no evictions happened, so none given). In Sarangani, if any private landowners leased their land, they would receive rent – but that’s a business transaction, not “compensation” in the sense of mitigation for harm.;Education|Capacity building|Financial support;Proponents of the project promised significant benefits for local communities, primarily centered on economic development and agricultural modernization. The most highlighted benefit was the creation of jobs—initially tens of thousands and later hundreds in the scaled-down plan—which was framed as a way to increase local incomes and improve livelihoods. Additionally, the venture pledged to promote farmers' cooperatives and facilitate technology transfer, including advanced irrigation and modern farming techniques, with the government even allocating funds for training. Other promised advantages included investment in local infrastructure such as packing facilities and roads, and a general economic boost for the region. The official narrative presented the project as a major development effort to uplift the agricultural sector and integrate farmers into global markets, but critics like KMP remained skeptical, arguing that these benefits were not worth the fundamental loss of land rights for local farmers.;Education|Productive infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, tractors, machinery...)|Capacity building|Other;"While the project's benefits have not met the grand scale originally promised, some have materialized for the local community in Sarangani. The most direct benefit has been the creation of local jobs, providing steady income for residents employed on the banana plantation. Additionally, there has been knowledge transfer, as local workers have been trained in modern agricultural practices, including advanced irrigation and export-quality production standards.

However, many of the more transformative promises have fallen short. There is no evidence of farmers' cooperatives gaining ownership stakes or of the project diversifying beyond bananas. The materialized benefits are largely confined to direct employment and minor community support, rather than broad economic upliftment or empowerment for the wider community. In Davao del Norte, where the project was canceled, neither the promised benefits nor the feared negative impacts ever occurred.";"Several organizations, primarily led by the peasant federation Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), took significant action to oppose the project. KMP, along with media allies like Bulatlat.com and the international NGO site Farmlandgrab.org, brought the deal to public attention by issuing press releases, denouncing it as ""land-grabbing,"" and calling for a congressional investigation into alleged conflicts of interest. Their advocacy created significant political pressure and framed the public narrative around the potential negative impacts on farmers.

On the other side, the provincial government of Sarangani actively promoted the project's benefits, effectively countering dissent at the local level. The outcome of these actions was twofold: the intense scrutiny and opposition likely contributed to the failure of the original 10,000-hectare plan in Davao. Subsequently, the project was quietly relocated and downsized in Sarangani, where it proceeded with strong local government support and without significant publicized opposition. This demonstrates that while advocacy efforts did not stop the investment entirely, they successfully influenced its trajectory and scale.";State;Before the project, the land was not owned by any singular community or individual referenced in sources. The national government identified it as available land for foreign investment. Thus, the former owner on paper is the Philippine Government (which then effectively sub-leased it to RP Harvest). If small farmers had titles, they weren’t highlighted (maybe deliberately to avoid complexity).;Smallholder agriculture|Other;"The former land use was not virgin forest or conservation land; it was in an agricultural region. In Davao, much of it would have been small-scale agriculture or fallow land waiting for development.";Cropland|Shrub land/Grassland (Rangeland);"In Davao del Norte, if small farmers were cultivating, the land cover was cropland (e.g., rice paddies, corn fields, banana or coconut groves). Davao del Norte also had some shrub/brush areas on the margins of farms or unused parcels. About 80% of Davao del Norte’s area is designated for agriculture/forestry and much is already utilized

While it aimed to secure Bahrain’s banana (and possibly staple) supply, it raised questions in the Philippines about food sovereignty. Filipino activists argued it is unjust for Philippine land to serve foreign food needs when local hunger persists.

The involvement of Ambassador Amable Aguiluz V (a close ally of then-President Aquino) made it politically charged. The deal was criticized as having a conflict of interest, since Aguiluz’s family corporation stood to gain. It was insinuated that the “blessings of the landlord President” enabled this “massive sell-out”.

The case highlights that the deal was brokered with minimal public knowledge. It only came to light because of foreign media (Gulf News, Trade Arabia) and was picked up by local media and NGOs.

Ultimately, the project did not fully materialize as first planned. The grand 10,000 ha vision launched in 2010 “fell through” in the initial site. However, the investors did not abandon their interest – they adapted by moving to a more receptive locale (Sarangani) and scaled down. By 2013, with local political support, they proceeded on 85 ha and aimed for 500 ha.

As of mid-2020s, that scaled project is operational, exporting bananas. In that sense, the deal “survived,” but in a much moderated form. This showcases how local resistance and practical hurdles can force changes to international land deals, but not always stop them entirely.

The fears of thousands of displaced farmers in Davao did not come to pass in that province, thanks to intervention. Instead, the impact is now localized in Sarangani. There, the community seems to be benefitting from jobs but also now hosts a foreign-controlled plantation. The narrative in Sarangani is more positive (investment, jobs, development) as pushed by officials, which contrasts with the negative narrative originally in Davao.

Lease/Leaseback: A significant portion of land is held via long-term leases. The prime example is the leaseback of 7,805 ha from the DARBCI cooperative: land that had been owned by Dole was redistributed to farmworkers under land reform, then leased back to Dolefil for 40 years

Contract farming (growership): Dolefil also expanded through contract growing arrangements with farmers who retain ownership of their land but commit to grow crops for Dole.

Furthermore, 3,500 cooperative workers were ""retrenched"" from DARBCI after the lease-back agreement, effectively being stripped of their jobs on their own land.";Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Other;"Workers are also greatly exposed to hazardous chemicals which have led to “reported cases of skin diseases, stomach ailments, and illnesses related to the reproductive system especially for female workers” (Teruel, 2005). Jose Teruel, president of the labor union in Dolefil, have also claimed that: “Medical records from the Howard Hubbard Memorial Hospital owned by DolePhilippines in Polomolok, South Cotabato showed that last year, the top 10 6 chronic illnesses of workers in the Dole Philippines were hypertension, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus, gouty arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroidism, other cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis, osteoarthritis and menopause. 
“Dolefil's plantation contouring and diverting natural waterways caused land scouring that caused the loss of about 380,000 cubic meters of soil or close to 2.53 million hectares furrow slice. The hydrology of the region was also extensively altered with the deposition of the drainage lines and spring waters and artificial dissection of landscape because of gullying…. Water from the plantations was diverted to the trail resulting to land wasting and erosions which also ate up sizeable portions of the farms.”";There is no record of explicit compensation packages (for resettlement or damages) promised to communities in the context of this expansion;Because no formal compensation was promised, none was specifically received aside from the direct benefits in contracts.;Education|Productive infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, tractors, machinery...)|Capacity building;Many of these promises are implicit or generalized. Government agencies (like the Department of Agriculture or local governments) likely echoed these positive projections. Indeed, local media often portray such investments as boon: more jobs, more business for suppliers, etc. However, as later analysis by UMA showed, the profitability for farmers was questionable. It seems the promised benefits were somewhat idealized – high farm-gate prices (PSA claimed ₱19/kg for pineapple, whereas actual was ₱5/kg to growers.;Capacity building;Many benefits fell short of what was envisioned. For example, farmers’ actual earnings are far less than the rosy projections (the PSA figure of ₱19.37/kg vs reality of ₱5/kg shows a gap);"Organizations have been active in relation to this project, ranging from farmer unions and NGOs to local alliances and international watchdogs. Key organizations and their actions include:

Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA): A national federation of agricultural workers. UMA has taken a strong stance on Dole’s expansion, conducting research and releasing statements critical of the conditions for farmers.

Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP): A national peasants’ movement. KMP’s chair Rafael Mariano (who later became Agrarian Reform Secretary briefly) criticized how land reform exemptions allowed multinationals like Dole and Del Monte to retain large landholdings

REAP Mindanao Network (Network Resisting Expansion of Agricultural Plantations): Formed in 2015, comprising NGOs, church groups, indigenous federations (e.g., Katribu), academic researchers.
Allah Valley Landscape Development Alliance (AVLDA): This is a coalition of local government units (municipalities in South Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat) concerned with environmental management of the Allah Valley. AVLDA took the notable action of passing a resolution to block further expansion of pineapple/banana in T’boli until environmental safeguards are ensured.

International NGOs / Media: GRAIN (the NGO behind farmlandgrab.org) has highlighted Dole’s expansions globally and regionally

ILRF (International Labor Rights Forum) researched pineapple supply chain labor issues and published reports that include the Philippines";Community|Private (smallholders);"Mix of ARB cooperatives (e.g., DARBCI), individual smallholders, and indigenous communities (customary tenure); corporate assets transferred via the Itochu deal at parent level.";Smallholder agriculture;"Mosaic of smallholder cropland/grassland and existing estates converted or consolidated to contiguous fruit monocultures; LGUs flagged watershed/erosion issues in uplands (e.g., T’boli).";Shrub land/Grassland (Rangeland)|Cropland;ands converted to plantations were previously used for growing staple food crops like rice and corn, which has contributed to the country's declining food self-sufficiency;#current####Banana, Pineapple;"Pineapple production is chemically intensive, using pesticides like Diazinon and Endosulfan. Dole sold over 25 million boxes of pineapple worldwide in 2004

Banana production dropped 30% from 2012-2015 due to drought and disease but recovered post-expansion";;;;;2017#current#1400#Pineapple;The LMPC co-op has 445 members growing pineapples exclusively for Dolefil, supported by a P212.8M loan from LandBank;;;;;;;Yes;;Yes;;United States of America;;Japan;65.0;China;;The vast majority of produce is for export. Japan is a particularly large market, importing roughly 65% of fresh pineapple shipments from the Philippines in 2006.;Yes;Dolefil operates extensive processing facilities in Polomolok, South Cotabato, including a large cannery, juice concentrate plant, freezer, and can manufacturing plant.;"Facilities include a cannery with a capacity of 110 tons per hour, a can manufacturing plant producing 2 million cans per day, and a corrugated box plant. These facilities existed pre-expansion and were described as ""underutilized""";Products include canned pineapple (slices, chunks, tidbits), crushed pineapple, juice concentrate, and clarified pineapple juice.;Unknown;The expansion increased water demand, with Itochu's plan explicitly including investment in irrigation to boost yields;Groundwater|Surface water|River;Water is drawn from local rivers and groundwater aquifers. A major issue is the pollution of these sources. Dolefil disposes of its liquid wastes through a canal into a waste basin, which then flows into a river leading to Sarangani Bay.;;;;Unknown;;Expansion/investment included irrigation upgrades and farm relocation to better-watered sites (esp. bananas), increasing water use alongside processing needs.;Women are disproportionately affected by the project's negative impacts. Most women work as contract laborers in the cannery and packing divisions, receiving lower pay and fewer benefits than the predominantly male field workers. The company's labor flexibilization strategy hit women hardest, as many regular female employees were fired or pushed into contract work. There are also reports of verbal abuse and sexual harassment in the packing plants, with women who file reports being fired. The company has also been accused of discriminating against pregnant women.;"This is a long-established and large-scale agricultural investment that is central to Mindanao's economy but is deeply controversial. The 2013 acquisition by Itochu Corporation triggered a new wave of expansion, intensifying long-standing issues.



The business model relies on controlling vast tracts of land through lease-backs and contract farming, leading to land conflicts, displacement of indigenous communities, and threatening local food security. Environmentally, the monoculture model is criticized for causing severe soil erosion, water pollution, and chemical contamination.




From a labor perspective, the ""contractualization"" of up to 77% of the workforce is the most critical issue. This two-tiered system leaves tens of thousands of workers in poverty with low wages, no job security, and an inability to organize, while the company has actively engaged in union-busting and intimidation. In summary, while the investment generates significant export revenue, its model raises serious questions about its contribution to sustainable, equitable development for the people and environment of Mindanao.";False;

The mill and cultivation area now managed by GPPOL were formerly operated by Solomon Islands Plantations Limited, a semi–state-owned palm oil company that ceased operations in July 1999 following the Isatabu uprising. When palm oil operations were set to resume years later, an agreement was required to address uncertainties over land ownership of the core plantation estates. Under the new arrangement between the government, SIPL, local landowners, and GPPOL, SIPL’s leases were cancelled and landowners instead leased their blocks directly to GPPOL (vs. the lease-leaseback arrangement used by SIPL). As part of this agreement, the government’s equity share was also removed. 

[Contract Farming]
Arrangements were eventually made with the loka matata landowner group for a 503 ha segment of the Tetere plantation to be operated as an out-grower block by Binu villagers. A further combined total of 314 ha, entailing mostly smaller blocks scattered around the main plantation estates, were subsequently included, bringing the out-grower component to 817 ha. By September 2014, the total outgrower area had expanded to 1,192 hectares.

The general manager of GPPOL at the time, Andrew Kerr, responded by saying that their company had no legal obligation to pay a dividend as it was based on profit calculated with a number of other factors. Moreover, Kerr claimed that there had been false statements and accusations going around which might prompt them to pursue legal action. Howver, GPRDA's then president Fr.

A  Special Purpose Vehicle known as Shonga Farms Holding was established.  This was specifically established to finance activities at the farms. Shonga project is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) involving the banks, the state government and the white farmers and it is managed by the Shonga Holdings. Five banks, Intercontinental, Guaranty Trust, Finbank, Platinum Habib Bank (Bank PHB) and Unity Bank are the participating banks, owning 45 percent shares of the farm. The farmers own 40 percent and the state government takes the remaining 15 percent share. Once the banks are able to get back money invested into the partnership, the farmers can largely own their farms. The Kwara State government provided the Zimbabwean farmers with interest-free loans in the region of US$3 million in 2005 to enable start-up operations. In addition, the Zimbabwean farmers formed a consortium known as the “New Nigerian Farms” in partnership with the state government and used this platform to access a loan of US$5 million from the federally owned Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) in 2006. Only 19% of the loan was repaid with both the white farmers and the state government defaulting on their loan obligations to the NACRDB.

The community claims that the land agreement was not discussed entirely and the community was not given the opportunity for free and prior informed consent regarding some of the clauses in the lease agreement (another source states that the draft land lease was disclosed to the community for one year in order to obtain FPIC). ABSL invented a legal instrument, the so called Acknowledgement Agreements (AA). AAs are additional agreements that were signed with each landowning family when their land was about to be used for the project. ABSL hired a consultant specialised on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that would map the land together with the owners. AAs include an additional rent, which is paid directly to the land owner. AAs include a formal declaration of support for the project and a recognition of the Land Lease Agreement (LLA) signed by the paramount chiefs. A 2020 report claims that communication still remains a problem because formats like village level community meetings or multistakeholder meetings are no longer held regularly. As a result people are not adequately informed about the company and even left out. Information passed on to few representatives at meetings conducted by Sunbird is failing to trickle down to communities.

Elephant grass is sometimes cut outside of operational areas causing conflict with local owners who expect compensation.;Yes;300;;;;92;;"The bioenergy project was designed to avoid any relocation of communities. 

When Addax scaled down in 2015, people were temporarily permitted to use reserve lands that the company has earmarked for future use. Many communities took the opportunity to start farming these large areas of land. They were only permitted to plant short duration crops. Long duration crops like palm plantations were prohibited. This situation completely changed in 2019 after Browns Investments Plc invested in the company. Farmers have reported being chased away by company officials from their plantations in the reserved land.

13,617 according to one source;  30,000 on the lease area belonging to 92 land-owning groups, according to Addax Bioenergy’s spokesperson, another report states 25000 community members. The African Development Bank estimated that that about 13,600 people in 52 villages would be affected. Another source states that there have been no houses or villages physically relocated from the area. The farmland of many families and villages has been relocated. Company source states 53 villages within the project area. Under the new project taken over by new investors in 2016, it is expected that 300 people, living near the Tonka community, will be resettled in 2020. According to the Sierra Leone’s Environmental Protection Agency, the main reasons for the relocation plans are environmental concerns. Water sources have been contaminated and ethanol residue pollutes the air. The closeness to the factory also poses an evident danger in the case of a fire. Sunbird Bioenergy shared the relocation plans at a multi-stakeholder meeting in March 2019 where the community was informed that the relocation would likely start in 2020 and that it would be conducted in accordance with local laws and international standards.";Eviction|Displacement|Other;"Community members can no longer access their water source; the water which is available is contaminated by fertilizers. The bush fires have become more ferocious, posing a major challenge for the communities affected by Sunbird, destroying community properties but also company property. Villagers perceived serious health and environmental impacts of the agroindustry biofuel production. The company used fertilizers and different chemicals that entered the food system and local watercourses and thus had negative impacts during dry and during low water level of the main river. Silnorf stresses that the community members feel they are today left with two equally bad options; they cannot stay due to the pollution and the closeness to the factory, while a relocation entails a number of risks such as losing access to vital land. Furthermore, the area that the community will be relocated from holds important religious sites.";Compensation to the local chiefs and landowners (not necessarily the land users). 12 USD per ha per year, 64% of which goes directly to the owner ( the community claims that this compensation was not subject to negotiation and does not adequately reflect the benefit the community was giving up.;The company compensated the owners of crops and palm trees on the leased land with a small lump sum payment (6USD per tree).

Land lease payments to chiefdom authorities were also held by the company until they received electricity revenues from the government.";The project started off as a plant producing bioethanol for export and electricity for the Sierra Leonean market. Although the provision of electricity to the national grid had been paused at the time of writing, the company still produces biofuel and has recently commissioned an Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA) plant to produce alcohol from the sugarcane. Both the bioethanol and ENA are sold in Sierra Leone but are also exported to Europe. The company claims to have sold over 96% of alcohol for the production of hand sanitizer to fight the 2019 novel coronavirus. The company has installed another 7 million litres bulk ENA storage to a total of 27 million litres of storage.;The aim was to supply 20% of country’s total electricity to the national grid. In 2014, the company supplied power to the national grid, but production was short-lived and had to stop during the Ebola outbreak.

The workers are paid badly- with payslips ranging from $1.17 (below minimum wage) -$2.22 per day. In 2014, the company entered into negotiations with the four trade unions that represent the workers to update the terms and conditions of the employees for the first time since the mid-1980's. This resulted in an increase in average wages of 70%, increased t c.$4/day. As well as wages, employees receive overtime, maternity pay, holiday pay, end of service pay, bonuses and assistance towards school fees as well as free housing and healthcare for themselves and their families. By 2016 all workers will receive at least a basic salary at minimum wage level. The company often pays its workers late. In conjunction, if workers do not reach their daily targets they do not get paid- some at the Lokutu plantation even hire others as porters, or get their families to help them complete their daily tasks. Workers at the plantations complain of housing in severe disrepair, wages just over a dollar a day for intense field labor and a lack of proper medical care in the rural region. Following the publication of the social infrastructure at the plantations the company is  assessing and redesigning the social infrastructure. Community leaders state that communities members are only hired as casual laborers and the last time that a community member was a manager was in 1964 (under Unilever). Civil society organizations from the Lokutu area have documented numerous other labor abuses, such as the lack of contracts between the company and most workers, safety issues with pesticides and the violation of mandatory work hours.
 A 2019 Human Rights Watch report detailed how Feronia had abused the rights of local communities. These abuses included “abusive employment practices that kept workers in extreme poverty — including unpaid wages, exposing workers to dangerous pesticides.";;PHC/KKM2;"Founded in 1911. Feronica  acquired these plantations by buying 76% of Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC, registered in DR Congo). Feronia purchased these shares from Unilever. The company which purchased these shares was Feronia JCA Ltd, a Cayman Islands subsidiary of Feronia Inc.  DRC passed a new Law on the Funadmaental Principles of Agriculture (loi portant principes fondamentaux relatifs à l’agriculture) on June 24, 2012 that states, under Article 16, that land can only be attributed to companies that are majority owned by national investors. Company plans to list on the British stock exchange in 2018. Mafuta Investment Holdings fund and Kuramo Capital have injected $ 17.5 million into the capital- October 2017 (% share unknown as yet). By 2018, Feronia-PHC had received at least 118 million US dollars, including 49 million in loans approved by German, Belgian and Dutch development banks in 2015. ""They approved the loans despite NGO reports and statements from community leaders in all three plantation areas who had drawn their attention to the illegitimate and possibly illegal nature of the concession contracts as well as the appalling working conditions for labourers on the plantations and the many broken promises to communities affected by the plantation concessions.""  A complaint was submitted through the DEG complaints mechanism. On January 7th, 2018 it determined that the complaint was admissible under the criteria of the Independent Complaints Mechanism Policy, and the case is under review. In June 2019 Golden Oil Holdings Limited (""GOHL""), a wholly owned Mauritius special purpose vehicle subsidiary of African Agriculture Fund L.L.C. (""AAF”) announces that it has acquired common shares representing approximately 13.55%. 

In May 2020, Feronia announes that they are looking to restrucutre the investors/ shareholdering structure in this deal or alterantively sell the operating company to an affiliate of KKM. However, they also clearly state that this is not a final decision and the plans may still change. Meanwhile, the actual ownership of the company is still being contested in court procedures in New York, Delaware, Canada and DR Congo. The side that appears to be winning is led by Kuramo Capital and its investors, which includes the endowments of the University of Michigan, Washington University in St. Louis, Northwestern University, and Kamehameha Schools, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the South African Government Employees Pension Fund and Public Investment Corporation. 

A critical juncture was reached when Feronia filed for bank-ruptcy in August of 2020. Instead of exploring ways to grant the communities their long held request for the return of the land,  development  banks  handed  over  the  assets  that  Fero-nia held in PHC to Straight KKM, a Mauritius-based private equity  fund,  for  a  cash  payment  of  US$500,000,  an  assump-tion  of  a  portion  of  the  company’s  debt  to  the  development  banks,  and  a  commitment  to  invest  US$10  million  into  the  company. Through the sale, the development banks involved – UK’s CDC Group, Germany’s DEG, the Dutch FMO, Belgian BIO, and the Emerging Africa Investment Fund (EAIF) agreed to write off large portions of their previous loans to the com-pany. However, these banks remain involved in the project as lenders. Straight KKM is owned by various funds affiliated with Kura-mo Capital Management, which claims to be Africa’s “leading independent investment management firm.” Several institu-tional players are major investors in Kuramo funds, including: The  University  of  Michigan  Endowment,  the  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates Foundation Trust, the South African Government Em-ployees  Pension  Fund  and  Public  Investment  Corporation,  the  Royal  County  of  Berkshire  Pension  Scheme,  among  others."" (Oakland Institute, 2021).
In April 2021,  African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), an environmental watchdog, said the South African government’s involvement in PHC was highly inappropriate: “The bottom line here is that GEPF has invested the money of South African workers to entrench dispossession of peoples’ territories and colonial patterns of land ownership and power in the DRC,” said ACB’s executive director Mariam Mayet. Moreover.Kuramo Capital Management( KCM ) is involved  in a legal battle over ownership of PHC Oil palm plantations in the DRC.A legal battle has erupted over the ownership of the Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), an oil palm firm, which controls over 100,000 hectares of land in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).After acquiring majority ownership in the PHC plantations from European development banks in 2020, former partners have turned on each other with legal action underway across four jurisdictions for control of the company, valued at US$100 million Evlin Kuyek, researcher at GRAIN mentioned that Before KCM assumed control over the plantations, several European development banks held the majority of shares in PHC through Feronia and invested over US$150 million in the company from 2013 to 2020. When Feronia filed for bankruptcy in 2020, the development banks agreed to pass the assets they held in PHC to a private equity fund controlled by the KCM for a cash payment of US$500,000 and agreed to write off large portions of their remaining debt. The deal was conditional on the new owners investing US$10 million in PHC and implementing a revised environmental and social action plan. PHC's new Director General, Monique Gieskes, was sentenced in 2021 by a court in the DRC to six months in prison and required to repay $780,000 that she is reported to have stolen from a Dutch clothing company she represented in the DRC. In 2020, another group, called KKM2 took over from the PHC.  KCM is the majority owner of Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), which operates three oil palm plantations in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo.

Several legal battles are raging between shareholders for the control of the Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC) oil palm plantations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Walé Adeosun, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Kuramo Capital Management, is accused of fraud and money laundering.

In 2024,PHC SA was plagued by accusations of financial mismanagement, including unauthorized bonus payments and suspicious financial transactions. The Congolese directors have accused the general director Monique Gieskes and the majority shareholder SKKM2 of significant financial irregularities, including a substantial bonus payment and transactions linked to money laundering and the financing of insurgent movements like M23.The Congolese government, a minority stakeholder in the company, is advocating for a thorough audit to improve company management. However, the appointment of Julia Luhonga as the new Board President, a decision made by the Portfolio Minister, has been met with opposition from the majority shareholder SKKM2, who are perceived as trying to dodge oversight from the state.";36439;Plantations Et Huileries du Congo sa (PHC);Congo, Dem.

In late October/early November representatives from the company visited the local communities and heard their concerns.;Rejection;The local community state that the land was illegally taken from them and reject the project. The communities claim that the title deeds for the land are falsified to represent Feronia as the legal owners. One report states that the community suffer from intimidation from the police if they protest against the project. The company response to intimidation  is that the company has a whistleblower policy in place and is developing a community grievance mechanism. The community is fighting back, claiming their lands back. In October 2015,  12 leaders from communities affected by the plantations met in Kampala to discuss actions which can be taken in order to get their land back. NGO's and civil society organizations were also at the meeting. The  leaders established a new alliance of communities affected by Feronia. on May 24 and 25, 2018, the Lokutu people protested vigorously against the recent cases of abuse committed by the new armed security company TANGANYIKA. peace agreements had been signed in August 2017.

In parts of the three plantations, residents  said their drinking water has been contaminated by PHC activities.
According to testimonies by local villagers provided to RIAO-RDC, the contingent of soldiers, police and guards went on a rampage through the local villages searching for evidence of theft. Villagers that RIAO interviewed allege that they broke into homes, arrested people arbitrarily, damaged property and committed numerous other human rights violations. There are allegations that they physically beat and tortured villagers, shot and injured several villagers, raped village women and burnt down people’s homes. The villagers say there was no possible justification for such a large-scale crack-down.
 A 2019 Human Rights Watch report detailed how Feronia had abused the rights of local communities this includes routinely dumping untreated industrial waste, which contaminated a major supply of local drinking water, amongst others.It was also reported that company security staff “forcefully repressed opposition through murder, unlawful detention, beatings and torture”

As the legal cases unfold, violence perpetrated by PHC plantation security guards has continued unabated. On February 15, 2021, Blaise Mokwe, a 33-year old villager, was falsely accused of stealing palm fruit from the plantation and beaten by PHC security guards. He died from his injuries a few days later. The same month, 20-year old Efolafola Nisoni Manu and another young man were accused of stealing plastic chairs from the plantation by security guards who reportedly sent soldiers to arrest them. While being transferred to prison in a PHC-owned motorized canoe, the two young men were allegedly handcuffed and beaten. According to local sources, Efolafola Nisoni Manu was then thrown into the water and killed.

Based on testimonies gathered during  field research from  the community staying on the Feronia concession and how they experience and fight against the company. They have  accounted repression and heavy-handed responses by the security services, which highlight the dangers faced by those defending their land, their livelihoods and the environment.

Livelihoods are severely impacted — hunger and poverty are widespread while the dumping of untreated industrial waste has polluted a major source of drinking water. Having lost their lands and reduced to working as laborers on the plantations, community members face poor wages and unsafe working conditions.

An independent investigation carried out in September 2021 brought to light the escalation of violence against community members. On September 14, soldiers and PHC security guards reportedly looted and destroyed dozens of homes, tortured and kidnapped villagers from communities surrounding the plantations.

On January 8, 2022, after a group of workers at the Boteka plantation went on strike to protest poor wages, PHC called in the police and military who opened fire on the protesters, seriously wounding two workers.

on the claim that their ancestors were the first to clear the virgin forest land for cocoa production. Other land users who also designate themselves as indigenous – so, strictly speaking, as first-comers – enjoy only access to communal land allocated by the sub-chief. A third category of land users in the ScanFarm area are migrant farmers coming from other places in Ghana or elsewhere.(Kirst, p12-13)";Not consulted;"The Municipal Chief Executive of the Asante Akim North Municipal Assembly, Thomas Osei-Bonsu in an interview told ghanabusinessnews.com that Scanfuel Ghana Ltd., is not registered with the local authority. He indicated that the entrance of Scanfuel into the area was facilitated by deceit. The land was acquired from the paramount chief of Agogo, Nana Akuoku Sarpong- the land was acquired through the Agogo 
Traditional Council (ATC).

“The farmers were misinformed at the beginning of the project,” Osei-Bonsu said. According to him, the farmers were told they were going to be engaged as outgrowers for Scanfuel but were not told they were going to lose their lands, but as it turned out, their arable lands have been taken away from them.

"" In the case of ScanFarm the hidden power of the Paramount Chief to act as owner of the land manifests itself in his ability to conduct negotiations alone and not be accountable to anybody in his decisions.

Another source states that the communities were not subject to free, prior and informed consent. The government transferred the land to the company with a whole host of unresolved issues.

Other report mentioned there was  serious allegations of corruption, lack of transparency and non-implementation of corporate social responsibility promises by SOCFIN.

In Sierra Leona for RSPO certification, Malen Radio broadcasted information about the audit two weeks before the audit in September 2020. One community leader stated he was informed by a company liaison officer who visited the communities 5 days in advance. Some civil society groups said they received notice 3 to 5 days in advance, while others were not notified at all. Civil society organisations from Pujehun district said they did not receive a formal invitation or agenda, which made it difficult to prepare. A second audit took place in early November 2020, according to SCS,2 because they were unable to process all stakeholder comments from the first audit or meet with newly identified stakeholders. SCS did not reach out proactively to international and national civil society organisations to prepare and inform the audits, despite publicly available reports, media statements and other communication about SAC and Socfin as well as news items on Socfin and Bolloré SLAPP suits against those organisations and individuals. Even though their internal communication shows that SCS was well aware of the controversial nature of the company and the high credibility risk.
An important stakeholder group called the Malen Affected Land Owners and Land Users Association (MALOA) stated they were not properly consulted.Although several leaders met informally with one of the auditors, their proposal for a proper consultation meeting with MALOA members was not agreed to by the auditors, reportedly because of security concerns. One company representative confirmed to the researcher that SCS had to return for a second field audit because several stakeholders were not consulted, including MALOA. However, even during that second visit, the auditors failed to consult MALOA. MALOA leaders also stated that the list of stakeholders the company provided to the auditors was heavily biased towards its proponents.";Mixed reaction;According to Green Scenery, corruption and pressure was applied on land-owners and town chiefs to sign agreements.the establishment of the company has met with significant resistance from the local population. People from several communities affected by the SAC lease area have formed the Malen Affected Landowners Association (MALOA) to defend the rights of landowners and land users. Several individual landowners have also sent official complaints about tree-crop and oil palm plantations that SAC destroyed, allegedly without their permission, to the senior district officer and other local authorities.There have been several confrontations in the area between SAC surveyors and heavy equipment operators and local people protesting SAC intrusion on their lands, some of which have led to arrests. In December 2012, more than 100 aggrieved landowners and users met in Pujehun and signed a resolution calling for the Human Rights Commission to intervene on their behalf and saying they would no longer permit Socfin personnel or machines on their land. On 9th December 2013, another protest was held by the elders to allow people to again express their grievances to the Paramount Chief over the lease of land. Hundreds were waiting in the village of Libby Malen for the chiefdom authorities to arrive when they learned that nine of their fellow villagers had been beaten and arrested by the police en route to the meeting.The rest of the villages fled from the protest spot immediately but were confronted with an armed contingent of police who fired tear gas and live bullets into the crowd, leaving many people with serious injuries. After continuous complaints government, the villagers are still not heard. The local communities have protested against Bollore within the wider protests against the company. 5 Landowners have been found guilty by a high court in Southern Sierra Leone after they were allegedly found guilty of damaging the plantation- prison for 5 months or a fine of $5,100 each. The company claims that they obtained consent from the community and followed the procedures laid out in the law. Workers downed tools in May 2017 and demanded the company engage in discussions on grievances. A new agreement has been drafted as a result where most grievances are addressed, but this is still to be signed by the company manager.;Yes;"In October 2011, 40 protesters were arrested after clashes. The people criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the transaction and the lack of real consultation and information. The violence and protest continue by company workers and landowners in 2019 two civilians were confirmed shot by military personnel.
MALOA members and leaders stated they have not been properly consulted. Therefore, it is likely that the auditors did not take into account their evidence on land disputes. Their grievances include: landowners were sidelined during lease agreement negotiations, FPIC was not respected, physical land demarcation disappeared, some families have lost all their land, lands were taken without due compensation, right to food is undermined, the annual lease payments are too low and the payment method is not inclusive, alternative livelihoods are not available and employment is too low, and communities are separated because the company changed roads. MALOA pleads for a return of land to communities.
Recently, in 2024, a dialogue was facilitated by the Chief Minister of Sierra Leone with stakeholders in the Malen Chiefdom. During this meeting, prolonged tensions between the local community and Socfin Agricultural Company (SAC) were discussed. The outcome was a promise to renegotiate the agreement with the company to address community concerns regarding compensation, human rights, and community development.";Yes;10000;;;;;;"In 40 villages, Since March 2014 Libby Village has been forced to halt their subsistence farming so that the company could carry out surveys and brush the land.

Communities also report that the use of chemicals and fertilizers in SOCFIN’s operations have made swamps in the plantation area unsuitable for cultivation.

According to The ex-president Ernest Bai Koroma of the last All People’s Congress (APC) the first protest against the land grabbing by Socfin in 2011 was violently repressed, forty people were arrested by the police and fifteen were pursued in court. In 2012, fourothers were arrested because they opposed the survey team of Socfin. In 2013, another fifteen people were arrested and detained. In 2014, six leaders of MALOA were arbitrarily arrested and pursued in court. Following a partial trial, they were in prison for several months; in 2015 another eleven people were arrested. In 2019, the tensions led to a conflict on the plantation that left two people dead and eighteen MALOA activists arrested,sometimes beaten and arbitrarily detained for several weeks.

Oil palm plantation company Socfin has meant violence and oppression for affected communities in several African countries
Since the company's arrival, communities, and women in particular, have faced violent incidents, criminalization and harassment

A second round of investigations conducted by the Earthworm Foundation into Socfin's plantations in Sierra Leone and Cameroon has uncovered serious issues. These include evidence of sexual harassment, land conflicts, and environmental pollution.

Investigators found significant pollution of water sources and environmental degradation. Specifically, in Sierra Leone, Socfin was found to be lacking in applying measures to mitigate air pollution. Socfin has acknowledged the issues and stated that they are implementing corrective measures. They hired Earthworm Foundation to investigate longstanding allegations of human rights violations and environmental damage.";The General Manager of Socfin, Gerben Haringsma assured the Government of Sierra Leone and the people of Malen Chiefdom that the Company would live up to their corporate social responsibilities including the construction of a resident hospital, network of roads, schools, housing facilities, job opportunities for 10,000 people with special preference given to natives of the chiefdom. Moreover he promised that full payment would be made for existing plantations in the areas of operations to be followed by an annual payment of lease rents to land owners. According to Green Scenery, it is not clear what formula will be used in the distribution of the land lease payment between District Council, administration, national government and land-owners. Socfin originally offered US$220 per hectare as a one-off payment for the land, but this offer was rejected for being very low compared to the real value. Apparently the communities were paid a $40 000 for rent in 2011. The NGO Maloa protests since 2011 against the conditions under which an affiliate of the group settled on his land. Five of its members were jailed for two weeks and will be judged on November 15 2013 for destroying plants palm oil. Socfin now pays $12.50 per hectare per year to community members (2017). The company claims that each farmer received 1 million Leones ($135) in compensation for the loss of their crops and $2.50 a year for lease of each acre.;"The company compensated landowners who had grown palm oil, cofee and cassava. Banana and Pineaplles were excluded. SAC used the following rates: Oil palm: 1,000,000 SL per acre, Coffee: 600,000 SL per acre and Cassava: 400,000 SL per acre.
For plots within zone A, initially only economic trees were compensated. For plots within zone B and C, compensation was made for plots with and without
economic trees. Later, in 2020, a correction was made for zone A, where also areas without economic trees were compensated.
The company has looked at how local people who have lost their livelihood can be compensated. Socfin now pays $12.50 per hectare per year to community members (2017).

in 2019 over 600 acres of lowland area was ploughed and harrowed to allow communities to plant rice. Over 70% of the seed was purchased and paid by SAC. Additionally, an Inland Valley Swamp (IVS) rice program and women group ground nut production units were established under the Community Liaison Department.
In 2014, SAC Completed the building of Sahn Malen Mosque and Collaborated with the phone company AFRICEL to provide phone coverage in the entire Malen Chiefdom.
Further, it undertook various campaigns aimed at Ebola prevention efforts that helped sierra leone eradicate ebola within its borders in 2015.

On 4 February 2016, following a lengthy legal process, all six of the MALOA executive members were convicted and ordered to pay heavy fines or face six months imprisonment. In 2017, MALOA and Green Scenery approached the Government for the resumption of the dialogue process. Affected communities continue to demand an independent investigation, deeming it a prerequisite for the establishment of an impartial and effective resolution mechanism. On 6th November, the Executive Committee and the general membership of Malen Affected Land Owners Association (MALOA), expressed their dissatisfaction with the RSPO process and specifically the refusal of the SCS Global Services Audit Team to hold an open General Meeting at Sahn Malen Court Barray. The President made a solemn promise in 2018 to the hard-pressed aggrieved land owners and the people of the chiefdom, that he will resolve the festering land dispute between them and the palm oil producer. ""Green Scenery believes that the conflict resolution process should consider the renegotiation of irregular land lease agreements, and take into account the negative impact of the company’s activities on the rights of Malen citizens, including environmental impact and implementation plans, criminalization, compensation and indemnification.""

The national coordinator of the women’s advocacy network WORNAPI, released a podcast to highlight the voices of women living with the impacts of industrial plantations. In November 2020, several civil society actors filed a complaint with SCS, alleging violation of RSPO’s standard for Certification Systems. SCS informed complainants that confidentiality during the complaints process cannot be guaranteed. This prevented stakeholders from sending in detailed verified evidence of harm to the plantations and violations of the Certification Systems standard. Hence, this information is potentially not included in the assessment.

In 2024 June, a report by local advocacy groups and international NGOs remained skeptical about Socfin’s commitment to implementing the necessary changes. There is concern that the company's practices are in conflict with their Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certifications.Despite ongoing grievances and criticisms from international bodies, Socfin's impact on the community remains largely negative, as highlighted in reports by organizations like the UNDP.";Private (smallholders)|Community;"The government transferred the land to the company with a whole host of unresolved issues.

Despite being SA 8000-certified since 2001—an international standard for decent labor practices—Sumifru has been repeatedly accused of serious labor and human rights violations. These include excessive working hours, poor wages, non-payment of benefits, illegal labor-only contracting, and efforts to suppress union activities. The company has attempted to impose exploitative piece-rate wage schemes and has evaded accountability for numerous legal violations. It was even listed by DOLE among the top 20 companies engaged in prohibited labor practices. 

[Exposure to Chemicals and other Health Hazards]
Sumifru, though certified under Global G.A.P. standards meant to ensure safe, environmentally responsible farming and worker protection, has been accused of exposing its workers to hazardous chemicals without adequate safety measures. Workers report health issues such as vision loss, respiratory problems, skin diseases, and infertility due to pesticide exposure and lack of proper PPE—often having to purchase protective gear with their own money. The company reportedly provides such equipment only once a year.

[Harrassment, Intimidation, Union Busting]
After launching a strike on October 1, 2018, over demands for a CBA, regularization, and better wages, NAMASUFA union members faced escalating harassment, including house raids, beatings, red-tagging, and pressure to falsely certify Sumifru’s labor compliance.

The most critical incident occurred on October 11, when combined forces from the AFP’s 66th IB, PNP, and hired goons violently dispersed strike camps at five packing plants. Unionists were beaten, threatened at gunpoint, and several leaders were arrested and assaulted before being released. The most serious injury was sustained by the PP 250 Union President, who vomited blood, had facial injuries, and experienced difficulty walking and speaking. Despite a court dismissal of Sumifru’s TRO petition, the violent dispersal pushed through, underscoring the use of force to suppress the strike.

[Death Threats, Slay Attempts, and Murders]
NAMASUFA union leaders and members in Compostela Valley have faced ongoing violence and threats. After filing a labor claim in 2005, union chair Vicente Barrios and others were ambushed in 2006, resulting in injuries and the death of member Gerson Lastimoso. In October 2018, Danny Boy Bautista was shot dead, becoming the second slain union member. Weeks later, another member, Jerry Alicante, survived a shooting but was injured.

Refer to Data Source 8 for further information";Sumifru launched the Tulong Pangkabuhayan program in Compostela Valley, reportedly offering 450 displaced workers livelihood opportunities such as swine raising, farming, and sewing, with an initial P200,000 budget and support from local government agencies. However, the NAMASUFA union denounced the program as a sham, stating that none of their leaders received assistance and that their members were not displaced but had only ceased work due to an ongoing labor dispute. Citing an NLRC reinstatement order from August 6, 2019, NAMASUFA accused Sumifru and the government of using the program to mislead the public and weaken workers' resolve to assert their rights.;On June 9, a peaceful settlement was reached between 92 plantation workers from Compostela, Davao de Oro, and Sumifru (Philippines) Corp. through a conciliation-mediation facilitated by DOLE Region XI. Represented by their counsel under the Single Entry Approach (SEnA), the workers, led by NAMASUFA PP 90 leader Vicente Barrios, opted to receive separation pay instead of reinstatement. This decision was anchored on a Supreme Court ruling recognizing them as regular employees of Sumifru. All 92 workers voluntarily accepted their separation pay and cash bonuses, which were distributed in the presence of labor officials.;;;;;"Nagkahiusang Mamumuo sa Suyapa Farm (NAMASUFA-NAFLU-KMU)

Sumifru workers in Compostela Valley organized their first local unions from their packing plant units in the mid-2000s, to assert their right for better wages and working conditions. In August 2018, 8 local unions of Sumifru workers consolidated into one union under NAMASUFA, a 900-member union of rank-and-file workers in 8 packing plants at the time.

Although the Supreme Court upheld the Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) July 2008 order granting NAMASUFA’s petition for certification as the Sole and Exclusive Bargaining Agent (SEBA), Sumifru refused to recognize the union. The company claimed the union’s consolidation was illegal—despite the Supreme Court’s ruling—and argued that the workers were employed not by Sumifru but by A2Y Contracting Services, a third-party manpower agency it had hired.

Because of low wages, lack of benefits, exposure to hazardous working conditions and Sumifru’s refusal to recognise the workers as its employees, NAMASUFA launched a strike on 10 October 2018. The fight for regularisation of the Sumifru workers was brought to the capital city of Manila after union workers were dismissed from their jobs and the violent dispersal of their strike camp on 10 October 2018. In 2019, a Writ of Execution on Return- to-Work Order was issued by the National Labour Relations Commission (NLRC) in favour of the striking workers.

In its Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) operations, Sumifru grows bananas on a 2,200-hectare plantation supported by nine packing plants, with a total production capacity of at least 19,000 boxes per day or roughly seven million boxes annually. From this output, the company reportedly earns a gross daily income of PHP 19 million from its Compostela operations alone.";;;;;2019-04-14#current#2200#Banana;;;;;;;;Unknown;;Yes;;Japan;;Republic of Korea;;China;;Also exported to New Zealand, the Middle East and Russia.;Unknown;;;;Unknown;;;;;;;Unknown;;;"From February 2020 to February 2021, women workers from Sumifru including a young woman researcher, mentor and coresearchers from the Women Studies and Resource Center (WSRC) conducted the Feminist Participatory Action Research (FPAR).

[FPAR Findings]
1. Lack of job security
- Even long-term workers fear dismissal or non-renewal of contracts for not meeting production quotas.
- Backup workers—mostly women—face the greatest uncertainty, often going home without work or pay due to a first-come, first-served selection process.

2. Unsafe working conditions, long working hours, and low wages.
- ILO standards are poorly enforced. PPE use is only required during inspections, and the plants have poor ventilation.
- Exposure to agrochemicals leads to health issues like nausea and breathing difficulties.
- Women work 12–20 hours a day with minimal breaks and can finish as late as 2:00 AM, returning at 6:00 AM especially during peak seasons.
- Daily wages average PHP 365 (~USD 7), while Sumifru reportedly earns PHP 38 million (~USD 760,000) daily.

3. Unaddressed burden of unpaid care work
- Despite grueling shifts, women still shoulder housework on weekends.
- The COVID-19 pandemic intensified this burden, as women had to supervise their children's distance learning, often without adequate educational backgrounds themselves.

4. Lack of maternity benefits and social protection
- Maternity leave and other benefits guaranteed under RA 11210 are denied.
- Pregnant women work up to their due dates, and retirement or separation benefits are not provided by Sumifru or its service providers.

5. Use of militarism to break the strike and union.
- State forces violently dispersed strike camps, injuring women and threatening their safety and homes.
- Family members were also threatened, causing psychological trauma and coercing workers to abandon union activities.
- Robilina Limo, four-month pregnant worker and union member was kicked in upper abdomen during the violent dispersal in Packing Plant 115.

The claims suggest that for over six years, SUCAF RCA financially and logistically supported the violent armed group, Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC), despite being aware of the group's involvement in human rights abuses, including mass killings and child soldier recruitment. The support allegedly helped maintain the company's monopoly on sugar distribution in several regions. The Sentry, which investigated the matter, states that despite knowledge of these atrocities, Castel Group continued to provide support to the group, thus fueling conflict in the Central African Republic. If these allegations are proven, Castel Group could face significant legal and reputational consequences.

The conflict arose when the Murrimo Macadamia project was granted land that, although formerly tea plantations, had been occupied and cultivated by local communities for subsistence. The reassignment of this land to the company led to the displacement of residents and social tensions in the locality of Murrimo. Although the company did not conduct a formal prior consultation process, the communities expressed their discontent and fear of losing more land to large investors. In response, the NGOs Legado and LUPA intervened as mediators, facilitating participatory consultation processes and promoting the creation of a Community Conservation Agreement. This agreement helped redirect the conflict toward a cooperative solution, in which community leaders from the involved localities (Murrimo, Gurúè, and Mucunha) expressed written support for a conservation initiative that keeps land control in community hands.

While the agreement was signed in 2005, the official lease was only issued in 2007, pointing to a gap between political commitment and legal finalization. Similarly, although plantation activities began in 2008, the first harvest was only expected in 2009, highlighting the delay between initial replanting and actual production. Both cases underline the time lags and administrative hurdles that shaped the project’s early phase. In addition, while the concession legally covers 3,000 hectares and Timor Global continues to present the Fatubessi Estate in those terms, this does not mean the entire area is actively cultivated. Earlier sources show only 60 hectares in production by 2009, and although more recent reports describe the revitalization of the full estate, they do not confirm that the whole area is currently producing.

However, as of 2010 the International Crisis Group reported that the company was only cultivating small parcels while most of the land remained under community use and contested claims. This shows that while the lease legally covered 3,000 hectares, the actual productive area was initially very limited. Over time, operations appear to have expanded: by 2019 Fatubessi farmers were winning national coffee awards, and the most recent TYPICA records (2024/25) confirm that Timor Global continues to manage the estate and export coffee, now focusing on specialty production.

Over 400 families were reportedly involved in the dispute.

The English-language newspaper Khmer Times, which strongly defended the plantation and criticized villagers as “squatters,” was owned by T. Mohan, who at the time was serving as the CEO of Virtus Group—then parent company of Virtus Green. This dual role raised serious ethical concerns, as the newspaper apparently failed to disclose this conflict of interest in its coverage.

Tensions escalated when The Cambodia Daily exposed this undisclosed relationship, accusing Khmer Times of biased reporting. In response, Mohan defended his actions, denied unethical conduct, and accused The Cambodia Daily of slander and hidden agendas.

In another article published by The Khmer Times, it was reported that families who had previously surrendered their land claims and accepted compensation reverted to rural extortion after receiving the cash. The chief ranger of Bokor National Park was quoted as saying that villagers continued to encroach on other areas within Virtus Green Plantations’ (VGP) concession, constituting a violation of the company’s ELC license. According to a VGP official, these encroachments occurred within a boundary trench marked by 37 plastic-wrapped poles, which were later removed and destroyed by VGP with assistance from park rangers and police patrols.";Unknown;;;;;;;;;;;"A Khmer Times story headlined ""High Profile Land Dispute Resolved with Deal"", reported that  13 families had surrendered their land claims and accepted compensation.";Health|Education|Productive infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, tractors, machinery...)|Roads|Other;"1.

The land had historically been used by peasant families since colonial times and later by a state-owned company until 1989, after which it was occupied in good faith by the community.

to about 25.2% of total labor force in the case study area (Laongam District of Saravan province) were employed by the rubber plantation.

In 2016, over 890 families were displaced in Hoima district to enable the expansion of sugarcane farming by Hoima Sugar Ltd. These families now reside in an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Kijaayo village, Kiziranfumbi sub-county. They have petitioned the Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters seeking justice for the forced evictions.;Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Eviction|Displacement|Violence;"Hoima Sugar Limited has been found guilty of degrading parts of the Bugoma Central Forest Reserve, leading to calls for the company to be blacklisted. Environmentalists argue that Hoima Sugar conducted an inadequate environmental assessment and that converting the forest into sugarcane plantations poses serious environmental and climate change risks. Many of the victims of the forced evictions are now living in vulnerable conditions in three Internally Displaced People’s (IDP) camps in Kijayo, Kikuube district.

Thousands of residents from villages such as Kijayo, Ikoba, Muziranduuru, Kyabataka, and Kabango were displaced during a violent eviction on February 20, 2015, with reports of at least 26 deaths caused by the attack. Many survivors now face deteriorating conditions, including polluted water and violations of basic human rights. Female youth in the camps also face sexual and reproductive health challenges, including lack of access to sanitary products and sexual assault.

Lawyer Eron Kiiza criticized the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) for failing to uphold its mandate, noting that the destruction of the environment has severely impacted the right to a clean environment and overall livelihoods. Ongoing legal battles and controversies continue to highlight the tensions between land use, environmental conservation, and economic interests in the region.

The forest is  under threat of being wiped out as a result of encroachment of farmland, illegal logging and charcoal burning among others. It is estimated that six million tonnes of wood are annually transformed into 1.8million tons of charcoal from Bugoma forest at a cost ofshs40,000 ($ 11) a sack. Asimire Alice, a professional teacher and councilor for Kabwoya sub-county, says that the rate at which deforestation is taking place in Bugoma Forest worries the local community members, as they are complaining of the loss of natural herbs which they used to get from the special tree species in the forest.

Due to deforestation, there has been a direct loss of wildlife habitats. The removal of trees and other types of vegetation reduces available food, shelter, and breeding habitats. Wildlife is forced to migrate to survive and in doing so, end up in surrounding homes and gardens. This leads to increased human/wildlife conflict. According to WanaData (2021) there is also a high crime rate within the area, due to the increased number of people who were relocated from different areas of the country to help in cutting down trees, this has led to increased rape cases and defilement in the area.";The families seek compensation for their lost land, property, and livelihood, valued at over Shs 82 billion.;"there is no indication that the communities affected by Hoima Sugar Limited’s activities have received the compensation they sought. The families displaced by the expansion of sugarcane plantations in the Bugoma Forest have been seeking justice and compensation valued at over 82 billion Ugandan shillings, but legal cases have faced prolonged delays.
Despite several mediation and resolution attempts, including efforts from the Save Bugoma Forest Campaign and the Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters, ongoing litigation and a lack of concrete action have left many families in vulnerable conditions, living in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in Kijayo. Hoima Sugar has also faced criticism for failing to meet certain environmental requirements set by Uganda’s National Environment Management Authority (NEMA)​";Roads|Other;"Employment to the community locals
Rajasekaran Ramadoss, agriculture manager at Hoima Sugar Company, said the proposed sugarcane plantation would “improve the standard of living of those people” in the area. In the environmental and social impact assessment report submitted with its application for a sugar plantation, the company said it would also build schools and a hospital, develop an ecotourism project that comprised an eco-lodge, walking trails and a campsite, and replant the degraded areas.";Roads;Locals in the community work at the Sugar Factory;"According to The Independent (2021),  The Uganda Law Society and two Civil Society Organisations have filed another petition challenging the planned giveaway of part of Bugoma forest reserve in Kikuube district.
The applicants also want the court to declare that the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment report by Hoima Sugar Ltd was shallow, inaccurate and misleading hence threatening the right of Ugandans to a decent, clean and healthy environment. In 2020, the Water and Environment Media Network, National Association of Professional Environmentalists-NAPE, and Africa Institute for Energy Governance sued the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) and Hoima Sugar Limited over plans to clear part of Bugoma forest.
Civic Response on Environment and Development (CRED), a Non-Governmental Organization, is involved in supporting the families' petition to the commission.CRED is implementing the Community Extractives Governance Project, addressing land insecurities in the Albertine Grabben region, where communities face illegal land-grabbing and evictions.

Ugandan NGOs have filed a High Court injunction against NEMA’s approval of a sugarcane project, prompting NEMA to decline comments on the allegations. However, in a press statement, NEMA stated that sugarcane would only be planted on part of the 5,700-hectare area. Conservation groups and forestry experts warn that any deforestation in Bugoma Forest could harm biodiversity and water levels in the River Nile. Conservationists argue the project threatens tourism and the fragile ecosystem. In response, activists have launched the “Save Bugoma Forest” social media campaign and petitioned President Yoweri Museveni to intervene, emphasizing the need for government action beyond legal disputes.";Community|Other;It was considered a cultural site.

The conflict involving Plantations du Haut Penja (PHP) centers on allegations of misconduct, including tax evasion and labor rights violations on its plantations in Cameroon. The situation escalated when Paul Eric Kingue, the former mayor of Njombé-Penja, exposed these practices and was subsequently arrested in 2008 on charges believed to be fabricated. Various organizations, such as Transparency International, have called for a review of the judicial process, noting severe flaws in the trial. In 2024, the UN declared Kingue's arrest arbitrary, advocating for his release and compensation. This case has drawn attention to PHP's controversial practices amidst its significant role in Cameroon’s banana export sector​.
The land titles 328 and 329 in Moungo, covering 743 hectares, have been a source of conflict for Plantations du Haut Penja (PHP) for several years. The French company Compagnie Fruitière, which manages PHP, has occupied and exploited these lands for banana cultivation for decades. However, the company faced legal challenges related to these titles. In 2011, a court ruling ordered that the titles be returned to the local communities of Mouatchom, Loum, Bona Olo, and Bona Oho. Despite PHP's appeals, the Cameroonian Supreme Court upheld the decision in 2018, rejecting the company's claims to these lands. However, the company continues to use the land.";Unknown;;;;;;;;Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Cultural loss;The local community has raised concerns about the pollution of their water sources and the reduction of arable land, primarily due to the extensive use of a 743-hectare area, covered by land titles 328 and 329 in Moungo, which has been occupied and exploited by a French company for decades.

The communities plagued by the continued forced evictions comprise three categories: The first category consists of people who were born on the land since 1935; the second, those that settled on the land during and after civil wars, including the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) which lasted for 2 decades in Northern Uganda from the late 1990s; and lastly, those who settled on the eviction site at the instance of government in 2011 through the Nyamalebe Landless Association.

Update on 22-April-2025:
We found several media reports regarding the land conflict related to this project, which is an ongoing issue. A group of local residents associated with the local organization, Koperasi Sinembah Jaya Abadi Rohil, is demanding their rights to the land of the PT Gunung Mas Raya plantation. The basis for their demands is President Instruction No. 8 of 2018 (Inpres Nomor 8 Tahun 2018, see source 10), which stipulates that companies holding plantation business licenses are required to facilitate local community plantations for at least 20% of the total area.

The excerpt states: ""The obligations of companies holding plantation business licenses for oil palm cultivation include facilitating the development of community plantations for at least 20% (twenty percent) of the total area cultivated by the plantation company.""

No official statement found from both PT Gunung Mas Raya and its parent company, PT Salim Invomas Pratama, with regards to this issue.

Based on the 2013 and 2016 Forestry Spatial Database Books, there was no release of forest areas for PT Gunung Mas Raya. However, based on BPN data
Riau Province, PT Gunung Mas Raya has approximately 625 hectares of HGU.
Overlapping the plantation area of PT Gunung Mas Raya with forest areas based on SK 173/Kpts-I/1996 and SK 7651/Menhut-VII/KUH/2011, the plantation area owned by PT Gunung Mas Raya is in the forest area.";Unknown;;;;;;;;;;;;Health|Education|Roads|Capacity building|Financial support;;Health|Education|Roads|Financial support;"Social Impact Assessment Report was available.

Additionally, the compensation includes funding for public facilities such as schools and health centers, which supplement the commune's budget and partially replace the role of the State. Sometimes, these infrastructures are productive, as seen in the case of West African Farm in Ngith. For every 100 hectares obtained, the farm develops another 100 hectares for farmers on the opposite side of the irrigation canal and provides them with water free of charge.

The basin's configuration is such that the water leaving the borehole travels a distance of more than 150m to be reoxygenated so that it can best benefit the crops. The water stored in the 3 basins provides 11 days' autonomy in the event of a breakdown in the irrigation system.";;;;Yes;;;This project has considerably reduced land speculation in the commune.

The project has a joint venture agreement (JVA) with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for 3,500 hectares of forest land

Of the 2,500 planted hectares, approximately 25 hectares were cleared of forest by the host community to grow tubers and other subsistence crops, approximately five years before Lionheart leased the land and commenced its farm.

On October 29, 2018, Lionheart Farms (Philippines) Corporation (LFPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lionheart Agrotech Limited, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (“JVA”) with the DENR under the provisions of DENR Administrative Order No. 2005-25, for the establishment of an upland agroforestry farm comprising 3,500 hectares of forest land within Barangays";2016-09-01#current#In operation (production);"Lionheart’s project commenced on September 1st, 2016, when the trial planting of hybrid coconuts commenced ahead of the formal execution of the JVA on October 29, 2018. September 1st, 2016 is chosen as the appropriate start date for the project since this is when the SALM practices commenced on the Lionheart farm, in accordance with VCS requirements. During this time Lionheart has dealt with initial suspicion from NGOs, COVID outbreak, typhoons, droughts, elections, illegal loggings, wildlife poaching, not to mention carbon market excitement followed by collapse. 

At last, after three years of petitioning, collecting evidence and documentation, the indigenous peoples’ struggle began to yield some positive outcomes. In fact, the NCIP (National Commission on Indigenous Peoples) finally confirmed that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOA), previously entered between the two companies and the local communities, was based on an improper application of FPIC guidelines. Hence, NCIP decided to suspend Lionheart’s Certificate of Precondition (CP), which had been issued to allow the company to carry out their operations on indigenous land.
As a result, Lionheart filed a motion of reconsideration as of June 1 and 16, 2017, requesting NCIP to lift the order of suspension and allowing the company to resolve the issue by paying the required bond, whose amount had to be decided by the affected tribes, pursuant to section 23 of the 2012 FPIC guidelines.

In early 2018, the IPs claimed that Lionheart started operation without the Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) procedures from the NCIP. 
On the NCIP’s en banc resolution (CEB Resolution No. 07-124.2018 Series of 2018) dated September 28, 2018, Lionheart’s operation was suspended until it complies with the FPIC guidelines. 

Two months later, Lionheart, the Rizal municipal government, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) entered into a joint venture agreement (JVA) that entitled the coconut plantation its right to operate again. 
The IPs countered its legitimacy claiming that the JVA pushed through without proper public consultation as the resolution states that Lionheart should “submit the Environmental and Socio-Cultural Impact Statement pursuant to the FPIC guideline”. 

It appears that Lionheart never ceased its operations except for a one to two month period since the suspension order was first issued. Therefore, the company seems to have completely ignored the NCIP Commission en Banc resolution that, in principles, should have halted their operations.";;;;;;42000.00;Philippine Peso (₱);per ha;3500.00;According to the Philippines Indigenous Peoples Report: Among the onerous provisions of the MOAs signed by residents is the payment of 3,500 pesos (69.11 USD) a month per hectare for renting their lands.

Separately, Lionheart engaged an environmental consulting firm, Nucleus Consultancy, to consult with local community stakeholders, including specifically the indigenous community within the affected area.

According to a Petition: Meanwhile, the new FPIC process being carried out by NCIP and Lionheart, is presently being questioned by the Pala’wan tribes. The latter claim that such a process has reinforced divisions rather than building unity amongst them. Furthermore the attorney who is legally assisting tribal members on this case, has pointed out that NCIP did not involve tribal leaders in any preparatory meeting prior to the FPIC process. Not surprisingly, as of now, the exact procedures under which the FPIC process has been carried out remain unknown and no minutes of the proceedings are available";Mixed reaction;"In a survey of 789 indigenous households, 785 had a positive opinion of the project.
