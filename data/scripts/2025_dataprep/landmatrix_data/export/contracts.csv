B87uQO-C;404;Philippines–Bahrain Agricultural Cooperation MOU;2009-10-01;;;A bilateral memorandum of understanding on agriculture and fisheries cooperation between the Philippine government and Bahrain’s government. It set the stage for joint projects, including exchange of agricultural technology, experts, and the promotion of investments in agribusiness. This high-level agreement provided the political framework under which the RP Harvest land deal was later pursued.
IubPSCc-;404;Joint Venture Formation – RP Harvest, Inc.;2010-09-01;;;Formation of RP Harvest Inc., the joint venture company between AMA Group (Philippines) and Nader & Ebrahim Sons of Hassan Group (Bahrain). Finalized around September 2010 with a planned $300 M investment. The JV agreement outlined the roles: AMA would provide local facilitation and possibly equity, NEH (Hassan Group) would provide capital (foreign equity) and market access. This contract essentially green-lit the 10,000 ha banana project and established the vehicle to carry it out.
7ad5MZ40;404;Land Lease Agreement (Philippines to RP Harvest);2010-10-01;;5;"An agreement in principle that the Philippine government (through the Dept. of Agriculture or another agency) would lease 10,000 ha of public land in Davao del Norte to RP Harvest Inc. for agricultural use. Bahrain sources reported this as a 5-year arrangement to grow sugar, rice, bananas, etc. on public land.

Note: This lease contract was presumably signed or at least drafted following the JV formation. However, according to AMA Group, it was never fully implemented due to difficulties in land acquisition (they claim the deal “did not push through”)

Later, a new land agreement was made in 2013 for 85 ha in Sarangani (likely via a lease or agreement with the provincial government), but details of that contract (e.g. exact terms or duration) were not published – it was arranged by local officials rather than through a national lease of public land."
5L9mdQ2E;404;Investment Contract – $50 Million Deal;2012-01-18;;;A contract signed in Manama, Bahrain, wherein Nader & Ebrahim S/O Hassan Group committed $50 million to the RP Harvest project. This was reported in Gulf and Philippine media as part of the larger $300 M initiative. It likely formalized the financing: Bahrain’s investor would invest $50 M (initial tranche) with AMA Group as partner. The signing was widely publicized and effectively confirmed the project’s go-ahead. (Soon after, AMA announced the Davao land issues, but the capital was later redirected to the Sarangani site.)
atFrIw05;404;Ground Lease / Agreement with Sarangani Province;2013-07-01;;25;Following the failure of the initial plan, the project was relocated to Sarangani province through a new agreement with local authorities. After two years of negotiations led by then-Governor Migs Dominguez, a deal was finalized, culminating in a groundbreaking ceremony in Alabel, Sarangani, in July 2013. The event, attended by officials like Congressman Manny Pacquiao, signaled strong local political support for the venture, which secured an initial 85 hectares with plans to expand to 500. Although the specific contract is not public, it is inferred to be a long-term lease or usufruct agreement designed to support the banana plantation's operations for several decades.
8bym3AMW;404;Export Accreditation – BPI License PQ-209;2021-09-12;2024-09-12;3;Not a land contract, but worth noting: the Bureau of Plant Industry issued RP Bahrain Harvest Inc. a License to Export (Certificate No. PQ-209) for bananas. Issued in 2021, valid until 2024, this certifies the company as an accredited banana exporter. It confirms the project reached production stage and formalizes its right to export bananas internationally.
E98nygrQ;470;Leaseback with DARBCI (Polomolok Plantation);2008;2048;48;"Dolefil leases 7,805 ha of pineapple plantation land from the DARBCI cooperative (7,534 member-owners) in South Cotabato. ARBs (former Dole employees) retain land titles but grant Dole management rights. Terms: Annual rent ~₱15,737/ha plus ₱983/ha bonus; Dole guaranteed ₱50k/ha net income to ARBs (with cost deductions). Rent escalates 10% every 5 years. Dole paid 5 years rent upfront as advance. Dolefil performs all farming and hires cooperative members as farmworkers"
VJPsVSb8;470;Itochu–Dole Acquisition Agreement;2012-09-17;;;Parties: Dole Food Company, Inc. (USA) and Itochu Corp. (Japan). Itochu acquired Dole’s Asia Fresh produce business and worldwide packaged foods business, including Dole Philippines (Dolefil). Price: $1.685 billion. By this sale, Itochu took ownership of all Dole’s plantations and facilities in Asia. The deal was approved by Dole shareholders and closed in 2013. This is a corporate takeover rather than a land contract, but it set the stage for plantation expansion under Itochu’s strategy.
AlSIlAHo;470;Tripartite Growership MOA (LandBank–LMPC–Dolefil);2022-11-25;;;"An agreement between Land Bank of the Philippines (government bank), LACONON 100 Multi-Purpose Coop (also called T’boli Farm Growers MPC, South Cotabato), and Dolefil. Purpose: To support pineapple contract farming on ~1,400 ha managed by the coop. Terms: LandBank provides credit (e.g., a ₱212.8M loan in 2022) for farm inputs & equipment; Dolefil is the exclusive buyer of the co-op’s pineapples and provides technical assistance throughout the production cycle. Essentially, Dole guarantees market access and quality control, the co-op grows the fruit, and LandBank finances the operation. This MOA, first implemented in 2017, was renewed to continue the partnership, especially after the co-op recovered from prior financial troubles with LandBank’s help."
3rI0Ndcs;470;Local Land/Debt-Swap Agreements;2014;2016;;"Dolefil, during expansion, made informal deals with various individual farmers/landowners: farmers would cede use of their land (via lease or sale) and in exchange Dole would pay off their outstanding debts to banks or loan sharks. This was mentioned by Dole’s corporate affairs director: some landowners offered lands to Dole “in exchange for buying out their indebtedness”. 

These are case-specific arrangements rather than a single contract. Duration/Terms: varied – in most cases Dole then leased the land for long term after clearing the farmer’s mortgage. Such arrangements helped Dole aggregate fragmented farms into the plantation expansion. (No singular contract document, but a pattern of agreements reported in 2014.)"

Under the arrangements with the Binu out-growers, five percent of the proceeds from palm-oil sales go into a fund managed by the Tetere Outgrowers' Association, in which out-growers can access credit from. In order to repay debts, GPPOL deducts money from payments at the source."
VHn46yqZ;1019;;;;;"[Remaining 314 ha of Out-grower blocks]
The land tenure arrangements for many of these blocks differ significantly from those in the Binu area, as they are usually on customary land that, in some cases, has never been alienated or registered. To address this, prospective out-growers were required to complete a smallholder approval form which asks for confirmation of customary right to use and occupy land for the growing of oil-palm. Where agreement is reached on the participation of new blocks, GPPOL provides interest-free loans to cover start-up costs, as well as seedlings and technical assistance."
